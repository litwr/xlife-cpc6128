This program was developed under Linux using cross-assembler Pasmo and disk
image utility iDSK.

The script `compile' makes all files required for Xlife-8-CPC package and puts
them to a disk image file.  It uses Pasmo, iDSK and several utilities (bash,
grep, sed, awk, gcc).

It is required to write a name of the disk image into beginning of this script.

The file 'notepad4.bas' should be renamed to 'np4.bas'.  It is better to
compress it by BPC at first.
