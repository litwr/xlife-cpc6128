This program was developed under Linux using cross-assembler Pasmo and disk
image utility iDSK.

The script `compile' makes all files required for Xlife-8-CPC package and puts 
them to a disk image file.  It uses Pasmo, iDSK and several utilities (bash, 
grep, sed, awk).

It is required to write a name of the disk image into beginning of this script.
